# shadow
An annotation based API for Java reflection.

The system was inspired by the [`Shadow`](http://jenkins.liteloader.com/job/Mixin/javadoc/org/spongepowered/asm/mixin/Shadow.html) feature in the SpongePowered [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) library. The code in this repository is adapted from the package built into [lucko/helper](https://github.com/lucko/helper/tree/master/helper/src/main/java/me/lucko/helper/shadow).
